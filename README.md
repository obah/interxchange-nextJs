# InterXchange - Swap your NFT/ERC721 tokens for ERC20 tokens easily

This is a DeFi project that allows NFT holders to easily liquidate their NFTs by swapping it for ERC20 tokens or staking it to borrow the ERC20 tokens. The project has several parts - a blockchain backend, an oracle implementation, and the frontend, which I worked on. This repo[interxchange](https://github.com/obah/interxchange-nextJs).

Users need and should be able to:

  - worth
  - value if swapped or staked
- Interact with the smart contract to swap, stake, redeem or pay back tokens
- Add or remove funds and yield to the liquidity pool
