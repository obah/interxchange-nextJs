1. Might change the link of the table to button instead, to avoid setting the href
2. Maybe had the href to the data json or have a function that takes the data and sends to the component
3. Make isOpen be in parent components to close the dropdown after clicking
<!-- DONE -->
4. Let menu icon change to X when open
